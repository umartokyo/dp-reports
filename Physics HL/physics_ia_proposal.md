## Topic of the individual investigation
Pendulums
## Research Question
To what extent does the small-angle approximation accurately predict the time period of a pendulum at varying initial angles of release? (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 degrees)
## Outline Description
I will investigate on why small-angle approximation of $sin(\theta)=\theta$ doesn't work when $\theta>10$ and seek for the true model, comparing the differences, the error we get from the simple-angle approximation formula.
[I'm still debating whether I should include "Complete Elliptic Integral of the First Kind" (according to the internet) or its Series approximation to compare our small-angle approximation to it or not?]
Methodology wouldn't be too complex, just a string with a small ball attached to one end and everything held from a structure of some sort (details will be decided upon later description). For measurement, we could use a camera and calculate everything frame-by-frame in order to be as accurate as possible and eliminate human error. We would let the pendulum start from different initial angles of (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 degrees) and measure the time period. For every angle, we will repeat 5 times for more accuracy.
Independent variable would be the initial angle. Dependent variable would be the time period. Controlled variables include but are not limited to string length, mass of the ball, release method. 
For the raw data and processing of information, I could utilise my programming skills to analyse the data and graph the results.
