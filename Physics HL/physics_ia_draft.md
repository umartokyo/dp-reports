## Introduction (work in progress)
The purpose of this investigation is to explore the nature of pendulum's movement and limitations of small-angle approximation. In order to avoid complex calculations often involving Taylor series and save time and resources, in many fields such as but limited to Physics, Math, and Computer Science, small-angle approximation is employed.
## Research Question
To what extent does the small-angle approximation accurately predict the time period of a pendulum at varying initial angles of release? (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 degrees)
## Variables
Independent Variable: 
- Angle of the initial release of a pendulum.
	Explanation: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 degrees.
	Apparatus: Protractor $\pm0.5\textdegree$.
	(The reading error is the half of the smallest division that the analog instrument can measure.)
Dependent Variable:
- Time period of a pendulum.
	Explanation: Measured in seconds, time it takes for a pendulum to complete one full oscillation.
	Apparatus: Camera $\pm1$ frame.
	(The reading error is the smallest unit of measurement a digital instrument can measure.)
Controlled Variables:
- Experimental Setup (self-explanatory but will later put into table with explanations)
	- Length of a string
	- The ball (it's shape, material, and )
	- The height of the pendulum
	- Turbidity of the room (no wind, as static as possible)
	- Camera's frame-rate
- Human Errors
	- Initial push on the pendulum: We could use 
## Materials
- 2.5m thin string
- Small dense ball (spherical marble)
- Smartphone/Camera
- Stand for the camera/smartphone
- Black Whiteboard Marker
- Industrial Tape
- Protractor
- Pendulum holding structure (stable horizontal rod) (I think we had it at school, we've done a similar experiment at school)
- Several books/wooden sticks each of 1 cm or 0.5 cm thickness for release mechanism (I will specify this better later but for our experiment, we can just take books from library)
## Method / Procedure
1. Setup
	1. Attach one side of a string to a small dense ball.
	2. Connect the other side of a string to the rod, ensure the distance between the rod and the ball is 1 meter.
	3. Put a video-recording device parallel to the desired movement of the pendulum so the entire swing will be visible. Set 120fps on video settings.
2. Independent Setup
	1. Measure the height necessary depending on the angle of a starting position. (Formula will provided in appendix)
	2. Stack books to achieve this height.
	3. Put books on the ground, set marble on top of the books, on the edge.
	4. Verify that the string is tense and the formed angle of the string to vertical is correct.
	5. Start a recording.
	6. Slowly pull away the books to minimise the vibrations on the ball.
	7. Stop and label the recording after 5 swings.
	8. If instead of back-and forth swing, it starts forming an elliptical pattern re-do by returning to step 2.1.
	9. Repeat step 2 five times. (multiple trials)
3. Samples
	1. Do steps 2.1 to 2.9 for 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 degrees.
4. Dispose of materials safely.
