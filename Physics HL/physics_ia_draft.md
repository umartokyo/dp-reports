## Introduction (work in progress)
The purpose of this investigation is to explore the nature of pendulum's movement and limitations of small-angle approximation. In order to avoid complex calculations often involving Taylor series and save time and resources, in many fields such as but limited to Physics, Math, and Computer Science, small-angle approximation is employed.
## Research Question
To what extent does the small-angle approximation accurately predict the time period of a pendulum at varying initial angles of release? (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 degrees)
## Variables
Independent Variable: 
- Angle of the initial release of a pendulum.
	Explanation: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 degrees.
	Apparatus: Protractor $\pm0.5\textdegree$.
	(The reading error is the half of the smallest division that the analog instrument can measure.)
Dependent Variable:
- Time period of a pendulum.
	Explanation: Measured in seconds, time it takes for a pendulum to complete one full oscillation.
	Apparatus: Camera $\pm1$ frame.
	(The reading error is the smallest unit of measurement a digital instrument can measure.)
Controlled Variables:
- Experimental Setup
	- Length of a String: Measured using a ruler ($\pm0.1cm$) during the setup.
	- Mass and Shape of the Bob: Don't change the original bob after the initial experimental setup.
	- Turbidity of the room: Keep all the doors and windows closed, ensure air-conditioning and other systems do not release significant airflow.
	- Frame-rate of the camera: Use the same settings for all the photographs on the camera.
	- Parallax error in the camera setup: Camera will be set into a fixed position, perpendicular to the direction of pendulum's motion, in front of the equilibrium position of the oscillation. Largest focal length will be used to flatten the image, to further minimising the parallax effect.
- Human Errors
	- Release of the pendulum: We are using a brick structure which we will slide away to release the pendulum in order to minimise unintentional initial velocity.
## Materials
- 2.5m thin string
- Small dense ball (spherical marble)
- Smartphone/Camera
- Stand for the camera/smartphone
- Tape
- Protractor
- 1 meter tall stable brick structure
## Methodology / Procedure
1. Setup
	1. Attach one side of a string to a small dense ball.
	2. Connect the other side of a string to the rod, ensure the distance between the rod and the ball is 1 meter.
	3. Tape a protractor to the rod, perpendicular to the desired swing of the pendulum.
	4. Put a video-recording device parallel to the desired movement of the pendulum so the entire swing will be visible. Set 120fps and use the lens with the largest focal point.
2. Independent Setup
	1. Measure the distance from the equilibrium and height necessary depending on the angle of a starting position. (Formula and code is provided in [Appendix 1.0](physics_ia_appendix1.0))
	2. Stack bricks according to the calculations from step 1 on the floor and place the ball on top.
	3. Verify that the string is tense and the formed angle of the string to vertical is correct. Otherwise adjust the position of the ball and brick stack until the desired angle is set.
	4. Start a recording.
	5. Slowly pull away the brick stack in the opposite direction from the pendulum.
	6. Stop and label the recording after 5 swings.
	7. If instead of back-and forth swing, it starts forming an elliptical pattern re-do by from the step 2.1.
	8. Repeat step from 2.1 to 2.7 five times. (trials)
3. Samples
	1. Do steps 2.1 to 2.8 for 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 degrees.
4. Dispose of materials safely.
