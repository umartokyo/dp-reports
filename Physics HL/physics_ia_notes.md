The structure of the internal assessment is inspired from this [document](https://www.clastify.com/ia/physics/661c06a699d0863e558a4014).
## Consider Later:
- Would I have to add p-values?
- Single string is used to avoid elliptical movement in 2-axis.
Data analysis:
- Calculate uncertainties, take the average from several swings to reduce random error, and show error bars on your graphs.
- Comparing your measured periods with both the formula and the actual results will help make your conclusions stronger.
- In your conclusion, clearly explain how the accuracy of the approximation changes with angle. Then in your evaluation, think about possible errors (like the string not being straight or the effect of air), suggest better equipment (like a photogate or motion tracker), and mention the limits of the formula you used.
