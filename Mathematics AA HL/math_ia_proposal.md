# Mathematics IA Proposal
## Topic of mathematical exploration
Perfect password
## Research question
How does varying the length and character set of a password affect the time required to crack it by brute force, and what is the optimal balance for security?
## Outline description
This mathematical exploration will tackle the ongoing dilemma of what are the optimal properties of a password. 
We will be analysing the possible combinations of character sets with usage of combinatorics.
We will have a rough estimate to compute a time it would take to break it. We could either measure this using Shanon's entropy formula or just use the amount of possible combinations from the previous step.
We will analyse the graphs of how change in different parameters affects the complexity. (It might be logarithmic scale but it would probably be exponential or factorial)
We will make a function with all these parameters and use optimization with limits or derivatives in order to find local minima/maxima. (constraints and partial derivatives for multivariable optimization would be perfect!)
Maybe in order to verify it, we could run a linear regression or other statistical optimisation/learning model with the same formula?
